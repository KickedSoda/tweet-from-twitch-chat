# tweet from twitch chat Javascript
Source code to a twitch/twitter bot that I made.

make sure to have node.js installed on Visual Studio Code
in the js terminal run, 'npm i twit.js' and 'npm i tmi.js' this installs the packages. When running the program, execute 'node TwitchBot.js'

A customizable bot that allows viewers to tweet on a single twitter account from the twitch chat.  Allows moderator commands, e.g. delete a tweet, clear chat, etc. 


Here are some great videos/websites to help set up the tokens and the oauth codes.
